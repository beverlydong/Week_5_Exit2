Your Spotify playlist is a type of list. Here is the learning outcomes for this exercise:
  1. Create a dictionary from scratch, including adding key:value pairs to an empty one.
  2. Accessing and updating values in the dictionary.
  3. Deleting elements from a dictionary.

## Steps
No.| To do
:-:|:-
1| Lines 5-26 give a recap of the food:price dictionary that you created last week.
2| Starting in line 28, you will create a dictionary from scratch---this will be a shoe inventory at Foot Locker. Line 30 shows you how to create an empty dictionary.
3| In line 34, you will input the key:value pair of Jordan 13:1. This means that the branch has 1 pair of Jordan 13's. Then, print your dictionary in line 35. Do the same in line 38-39. Then, add 3 more key:value pairs outlined in lines 42-44 & put the code in lines 45-47, then print your dictionary. 
4| In line 51, you will access a value associated with a key from shoe_count by placing 'Air Max' inside the square brackets. What output did you get? Write this value in line 52.
5| In line 56, you will access a value and add it to a new variable. Line 57 then prints an f-string of this new variable combined with strings.
6| In line 60, you modified an existing value (the number of pairs fo Foamposite was actually 9 pairs not 10 pairs).
7| In line 64, also modify the inventory for Yeezy pairs from 8 to 9 pairs. Use the similar code as line 60. Line 65 prints the new dictionary so make sure Yeezy says 9.
8| In line 68, this code shows how to deduct 2 pairs of SB Dunks from the inventory. You put a minus before the equal sign then the number to be deducted. In line 72, use this similar code to deduct 1 less pair from the Jordan's inventory. Line 73 prints the inventory, so check the correct number is there.
9| In lines 76, this code shows how to add a value to a specific key. Line 77 prints the inventory. Line 80 also shows how to add to another key in the dictionary.
10| In line 83, this counts the sum of all the values in the dictionary & prints them.
11| In lines 87-91, add 7 pairs to all the brands (similar to the code in line 76 or line 80). Line 92 then prints the updated dictionary of inventory. 
12| In lines 95-99, deduct 3 pairs from all brands from the store (similar to code in line 68). Line 100 prints the updated dictionary.
13| In line 103, the total number of shoes in the inventory is counted and printed. Write the sum in line 104.
14| Starting line 109, you will make a dictionary of your own choosing from scratch. Line 109 gives an example that you can try. Lines 110-118 gives more suggestions in case you're stuck. You decide what key:value pair you would like to code.
15| In line 120, create your dictionary with your chosen key:value pairs! Afterwards, print them. 
16| Your dictionary may be long or short. After your create it, print it.
17| After printing your dictionary, access a value from a key:value pair. For example, if you created the NBA_players example with Stephen Curry's jersey as 30, you would access the jersey by coding this: Steph_jersey = NBA_players["Stephen Curry"] which is similar to what's in line 45. Print this value (modeling your code after line 26).
18| Afterwards, updat an existing value from 1 of the key:value pairs then print it. An example from the NBA players is changing Lebron's jersey to the number 6 using this code: NBA_players["Lebron James"] = 6.
19| Finally, delete an item from your dictionary and then print it. If you want to delete Lebron from the NBA players example, your code would look like this: del NBA_players["Lebron James"].
20| After running your code and checking everything in both main.py and exitticket1.py, go to the Version Control icon on the leftmost sidebar & send commit to Github.

  Use [Markdown](https://gist.github.com/cuonggt/9b7d08a597b167299f0d) to format your instructions.

  For example, here is a code block in python3
```python
def hello_world():
  print("hello world!")
```


  Include an image by placing it in the `assets` folder.

  For example, here is the Replit logo:
